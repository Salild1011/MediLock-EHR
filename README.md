# MediLock

Blockchain based Electronic Health Records (EHR)

MediLock proposes a secure and contemporary approach towards storing and updating Medical data of Patients. We implement this by combining the Electronic Health Record (EHR), which is a digital version of the patients medical history and blockchain, which helps in providing a universal set of tools for cryptographic assurance of data integrity and transparent data access.

MediLock provides a decentralised platform that is secure, fast and facilitates transparent exchange and usage of Medical Data. Blockchain ensures information on the chain is verified by requiring users to provide a signature and with a private key to store the data on the blockchain.  The health metadata blockchain and EHR systems together comprise a holistic solution that enables secure access to EHR data.

We intend to use blockchain technology to create a user-focused electronic health record and maintain a single version of the truth. MediLock provides a simple yet comprehensive experience to various stakeholders in the health care ecosystem.
